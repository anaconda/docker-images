Notice of Third Party Software Licenses
=======================================

Anaconda contains open source software packages from third parties. These are available on an "as is" basis and subject to their individual license agreements. These licenses are available in Anaconda or at http://docs.continuum.io/anaconda/pkg-docs . Any binary packages of these third party tools you obtain via Anaconda are subject to their individual licenses as well as the Anaconda license. Continuum reserves the right to change which third party tools are provided in Anaconda.

In particular, Anaconda contains re-distributable, run-time, shared-library files from the Intel (TM) Math Kernel Library ("MKL binaries").  You are specifically authorized to use the MKL binaries with your installation of Anaconda.  You are also authorized to redistribute the MKL binaries with Anaconda or in the conda package that contains them.  If needed, instructions for removing the MKL binaries after installation of Anaconda are available at http://www.continuum.io.

Cryptography Notice
===================
This distribution includes cryptographic software. The country in which you currently reside may have restrictions on the import, possession, use, and/or re-export to another country, of encryption software. BEFORE using any encryption software, please check your country's laws, regulations and policies concerning the import, possession, or use, and re-export of encryption software, to see if this is permitted. See the Wassenaar Arrangement <http://www.wassenaar.org/> for more information.

Continuum Analytics has self-classified this software as Export Commodity Control Number (ECCN) 5D002.C.1, which includes information security software using or performing cryptographic functions with asymmetric algorithms. The form and manner of this distribution makes it eligible for export under the License Exception ENC Technology Software Unrestricted (TSU) exception (see the BIS Export Administration Regulations, Section 740.13) for both object code and source code.

The following packages are included in this distribution that relate to cryptography:

openssl
    The OpenSSL Project is a collaborative effort to develop a robust, commercial-grade, full-featured, and Open Source toolkit implementing the Transport Layer Security (TLS) and Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) protocols as well as a full-strength general purpose cryptography library.

pycrypto
    A collection of both secure hash functions (such as SHA256 and RIPEMD160), and various encryption algorithms (AES, DES, RSA, ElGamal, etc.).

pyopenssl
    A thin Python wrapper around (a subset of) the OpenSSL library.

kerberos (krb5, non-Windows platforms)
    A network authentication protocol designed to provide strong authentication for client/server applications by using secret-key cryptography.

cryptography
    A Python library which exposes cryptographic recipes and primitives.
